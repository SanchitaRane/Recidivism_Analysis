# Recidivism Analysis

## Project Overview
**Objective:** Analyze recidivism data from the National Institute of Justice to identify patterns and factors influencing re-offense rates, providing actionable insights for rehabilitation program improvement.  

**Scope:** Focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Analysis using Python and SQL. The project includes data preparation, analysis, visualization, and findings presentation using PowerPoint.

## Analysis Requirements
- Identify key factors contributing to recidivism
- Analyze temporal trends in recidivism
- Assess correlation between program participation and recidivism
- Provide data-driven recommendations

## Dataset Description
The analysis will be conducted on recidivism data, including the following key variables:

### Key Variables:
- **Demographics:** Gender, Race, Age_at_Release, Residence_PUMA
- **Criminal History:** Prior arrests, convictions, revocations
- **Programs:** Attendance, violations, drug tests
- **Outcomes:** Recidivism within 3 years

## Technical Implementation
### Development Stack:
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **SQL:** SQLdf, PandasSQL
- **Tools:** Google Colab, GitHub for version control

## Analysis Plan
### 1. Data Preparation:
- Clean and standardize data
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical variables

### 2. Analysis:
- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Visualization creation
